First day of ComSci
Most of the class starts with some sort of orientation infos, but this class was a bit different. We were given this unkown
code and the teacher just let us solve it. Few moments later we all figure it out that it was some ROT13 and crack the code but
after that we actually went library to find more clues.
Overall it was very active and enthusiasing.


Day 2 of ComSci class we leaned how to use mac's terminal.
Overall it was a bit complicated but I found it pretty interesting learning cmds.
I have a really bad memorizing skills so I deffinetly need to revisit these cmds frequently.
We covered basic areas by using basic knowledges of computer science. To be honest I didn't know what "IP" stands for and now I
know.

Revisiting terminal cmds and also expanding our field. Today we created some program by using terminal.
Compare our skill level right now with the bigining of the year, it improved a lot but since we're doing step by step each
class, I found that it is pretty easy and well understandable. Also each activities are very interesting every day so I really
enjoying the class.

Today, we created some programs by using terminal. We earn some knowledge of loop code and created some simple game.
It started to become a bit complicated but still I'm enjoying my class.
Every day we get new concepts and developing little but efficiently.

9/11 19
learning while loops.
we learned several loops today. Starting from last class, my brains are really struggling to understand what is happening
and to memorize. It is better to train taking more efficient notes and revisiting it. It's better late than never. I have
to create that routine for my future academic years.
