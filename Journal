First day of ComSci
Most of the class starts with some sort of orientation infos, but this class was a bit different. We were given this unkown
code and the teacher just let us solve it. Few moments later we all figure it out that it was some ROT13 and crack the code but
after that we actually went library to find more clues.
Overall it was very active and enthusiasing.


Day 2 of ComSci class we leaned how to use mac's terminal.
Overall it was a bit complicated but I found it pretty interesting learning cmds.
I have a really bad memorizing skills so I deffinetly need to revisit these cmds frequently.
We covered basic areas by using basic knowledges of computer science. To be honest I didn't know what "IP" stands for and now I
know.
